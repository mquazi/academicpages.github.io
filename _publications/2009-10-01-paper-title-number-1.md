Abstract: In this research, we propose a longitudinal adjusted design eect model to
provide consistent estimates of variance by incorporating design eect and time
effect into modeling. Asymptotic properties of some certain type of estimators
are investigated. Simulation studies show that the proposed method works
very well and outperforms some existing methods in producing standard error
estimates.
Key Words: CPS, design effect, generalized variance function, longitudinal gen-
eralized variance function, longitudinal adjusted design eect model, simula-
tions.
