title: "Probabilities of unranked and ranked anomaly zones under birth-death models"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-12-20-kim-etal-probs
excerpt: 'In this paper, we study how the parameters of a species tree simulated under a constant rate birth-death process can affect the probability that the species tree lies in the anomaly zone. We derive the lower bound of the probability of the species tree being in an unranked anomaly zone with <i>n</i> leaves for large speciation rate $\lambda$, and we show that this lower bound approaches 1 as <i>n</i> $\rightarrow \infty$ and $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$.'

>Abstract: In this research, we propose a longitudinal adjusted design effect model to
provide consistent estimates of variance by incorporating design effect and time
effect into modeling. Asymptotic properties of some certain type of estimators
are investigated. Simulation studies show that the proposed method works
very well and outperforms some existing methods in producing standard error
estimates. \\
Key Words: CPS, design effect, generalized variance function, longitudinal generalized variance function, longitudinal adjusted design effect model, simulations.
