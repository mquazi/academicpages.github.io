I am currently pursuing PhD in Statistics at University of New Mexico. Graduated with MS in Industrial Engineering from University of Texas at Arlington in 2017. I got my BS in Industrial Engineering from BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore, India in 2015. 

My research interests are in field of survey sampling, generalized linear models, and non parametric estimation. I enjoy research in sports analytics as well. I like watching soccer, cricket and UFC. I enjoy playing volleyball and video games. 

My main research advisor is [Dr. Yan Lu](https://math.unm.edu/~luyan/) and I am co-advised by [Dr. Guoyi Zhang](https://math.unm.edu/~gzhang12/).
